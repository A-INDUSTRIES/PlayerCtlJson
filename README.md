# **PlayerCtl to json**
### Simple, short, written in rust.
#### This utility allow you to get the data (title and artist) of PlayerCtl.
##### The data returned by the program is under json format.
My use of this program is to give a custom Waybar widget the title-artist of what I am listening to. So may you!

###### NB: Refer to my .dotfiles repository for an example.

##### *Hope you like it!*
